	- Offline providers are hidden from customer discovery until they go online again.

## Expected Project Outcome Alignment

The reference outcome targets are largely achieved:

- Secure authentication and role-based dashboards: Achieved
- Location-based service search and booking: Achieved
- Provider-customer communication: Achieved
- Review and rating system: Achieved
- Admin verification, moderation, analytics: Achieved (deployment/final QA formalization remains)

## Database Schema Reference (From Project Plan)

Primary entities defined in the project document:

- Users
- Services
- Bookings
- Reviews
- Messages
- Reports
